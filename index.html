		I have around 8+ years of experience in software development. Involved in creating mapping documents from AS-IS to TO-BE for new applications. Was part of documenting the business requirements and creating High level design document. 
		Developed the new applications and performed the end-to-end scheduling of the application.All the applications were integrated and was able to genrate the extracts out of it.
		Got the sign-off from Business and the applications were deployed to higher environments and the Go-Live was successful.
